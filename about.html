            <p>You can call me Arnaud,or as my close friends call me Arno.
             I am excited to introduce myself as a skilled professional with 
      expertise in the crypto space. I have been actively involved in this 
    industry since 2018, working on projects involving DApps, cryptography
      concepts, and using programming languages such as JavaScript, Python,
       and Solidity. My experience includes working as a Business Development
     & Strategy Manager at Ambrus Studio in Shanghai, where I was responsible for investor relations, 
      marketing, and establishing strategic partnerships. I have a good understanding of blockchain fundamentals, 
   smart contract development, and the NFTs and gaming industry. I have also 
     gained experience as an independent day trader, and most recently as a Solutions Lead intern at diiVe in Cape Town, 
     where I continued to develop my skills in the industry. I started my career as a Social Media Analyst and U.S. Cryptocurrency Consultant at BIEX.com
    in Shanghai, China. I hold a Master of Liberal Arts from Harvard University, and a Bachelor of Science in 
    Finance and International Business from Quinnipiac University. I am proficient in Mandarin and even studied
     at Mandarin House Shanghai for a brief period.</p>
